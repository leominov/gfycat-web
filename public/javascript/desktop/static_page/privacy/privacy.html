      <p>
        Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Gfycat, Inc. (“Gfycat”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by
        Gfycat and has been created to provide information about our company and our GIF and video platform services, mobile
        applications and related services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Service visitors (“you”, “your”).
        This Privacy Policy sets forth Gfycat’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data
        (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.
      </p>
    </div>

        <span class="title">Information We Collect</span>
    </div>
    <div class="row content-block">
        <p>
          When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below: <br>
          <strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
          information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services
          or use certain Services. Wherever Gfycat collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred
            from your current location to the offices and servers of Gfycat and the authorized third parties referred to herein located
            in the United States.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Information:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Gfycat through the Services, we receive and store certain personally
          non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently
          be used to specifically identify you. Gfycat may store such information itself or such information may be included in
          databases owned and maintained by Gfycat affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and
          pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each
          page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal
          Data is available or used in this process.
        </p>
        <p>
          In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer
          that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality
          to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser
          that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to
          the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web
          browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
          notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
          because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services,
          Gfycat often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other
          information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Gfycat may share this
          aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
          Gfycat may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business
          partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Location Information:</strong> Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using
          the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location
          features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service. Please keep in mind that other users
          can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our
          control and without your knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others,
          so please be careful if you choose to enable location functionality. We may also use your location information in an
          aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Google Analytics and Similar Third Party Technologies:</strong> We may allow third party service providers to use
          cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites
          following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
          (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use
          the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

      <p>
        Gfycat uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal
        Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance,
        if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also,
        if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with
        access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Gfycat and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related
        Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services
        to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.
        Gfycat and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be
        of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out"
        of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing
        communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gfycat intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be
        informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

        Gfycat is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our
        relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain
        third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event
        of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent

      <p>
        <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Gfycat, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies
        to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases
        and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the
        information that they need to perform their specific function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Gfycat may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good
        faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or
        property of Gfycat, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public,
        or (iv) protect against legal liability.

        Gfycat does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please
        do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
        Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the
        Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data
        to Gfycat through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

    </div>

    <div class="row content-block">
      <p>
        One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable or log in to the Services via various social
        networking services like Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Service(s)”). By directly integrating these services, we
        make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or
        grant us permission via the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the
        Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary
        to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service.
        As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have
        provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information
        is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Gfycat shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy
        practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content
        through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge
        that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have
        enabled will be able to view such activity.
