          <strong>What is Gfycat?</strong>
        </p>

      <p>
        Gfycat is GIFs done right. GIFs come from the .gif (graphics interchange format) image. Still or static images can be a .gif file, but you‚Äôre probably more familiar with an animated .gif file. However, the .gif file format was created in the 80s (see GIF below)! Technology has come a long way since then and we have better ways to create and distribute GIFs. Size, speed, colors and controls are just a few of the improvements with Gfycat.

      <div>
        <strong>Why should I create a Gfycat account?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Accounts let you easily manage your own Gfycat GIFs and save for later the GIFs you find. It also gives you access to customize your public GIF profile as well as create GIF albums and playlists out of all the content available on Gfycat.

        <strong>Can I edit, change, or delete my Gfycat GIF after I upload it?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Only if you uploaded the GIF to your account. Otherwise, bummer! üòû</div>

      <div>
        <strong>What‚Äôs the maximum file size of video or GIF I can upload?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">No limit. 1MB or 1GB, it‚Äôs all the same to us.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>What‚Äôs the maximum duration I can upload?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Is it a video file or video URL? The maximum duration we will output is 15 seconds. You can load in any video of any length and edit the time down to 15 seconds or less.</div>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Is it a .gif file? Then, there is no maximum duration BUT the quality will likely be poorer due to the source file being a .gif file.</div>

        <strong>How do I share a Gfycat GIF on Twitter?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Gfycat GIFs play at much higher resolution than Twitter videos. The easiest way to share on Twitter is by just copying the link URL into the Tweet. The tweet will then show the GIF that, when clicked on, shows GIFs at amazing resolution and colors from the full spectrum light, 16 million. On laptops and desktop, we have a further nifty feature that allows your content to be uniquely identified to you if you‚Äôre the creator, by showing your profile picture and username.</div>

      <div>
        <strong>What if my site uses Wordpress or Medium? Does embedding still work?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">All you have to do is simply paste the Gfycat URL (e.g. <a href="https://gfycat.com/FavoriteFondAfricanparadiseflycatcher">gfycat.com/FavoriteFondAfricanparadiseflycatcher</a>) whereever you want the GIF to be placed and it will render inline as you edit. Embedding Gfycat URLs works even easier thanks to awesome formats like oEmbed and great services like Embed.ly. If your site uses either of these, you can quickly copy and paste a Gfycat link and move on to the next item on your to-do list.</div>

       <div>
        <strong>How do I embed a Gfycat GIF on my website, blog, or article?</strong>
        <div class="pad-bottom">Simple! Grab our iFrame embed by clicking the ‚Äú&lt;/&gt;‚Äù icon on any Gfycat link. We offer two: Fixed and Responsive. We recommend using the Responsive as it fits to your page or article width and translates great between desktop and mobile web for viewing.</div>
